# 0x04. Typescript

This project exposed me thoroughly to Typescript. After reading the resources and watching a comprehensive typescript tutorial with MOSH, I know the following and can explain them without the use of google::

- Basic types in Typescript
- Interfaces, Classes, and functions
- How to work with the DOM and Typescript
- Generic types
- How to use namespaces
- How to merge declarations
- How to use an ambient Namespace to import an external library
- Basic nominal typing with Typescript
